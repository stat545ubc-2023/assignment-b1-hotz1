# assignment-b1-hotz1

## What is this repository?

This repository contains the files corresponding to my work on the first assignment ("Assignment B-1") of STAT 545B at the University of British Columbia. The task which we needed to complete for this assignment was to create a function in R, create a description of the function using `Roxygen2`, create examples of the usage of the function, and use the `testthat` library to perform some basic unit tests for the function which we created.

## What are the files and folders in this repository?

This repository contains several files and one sub-folder which you may be interested in viewing. These are the following:
- [`Assignment-B-1.Rmd`](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/assignment-b1-hotz1/blob/main/Assignment-B-1.Rmd): This is an RMarkdown file which contains the R code for this assignment, split up into a series of individual chunks which can be run one at a time.
- [`Assignment-B-1.md`](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/assignment-b1-hotz1/blob/main/Assignment-B-1.md): This is a GitHub-compatible markdown file which is created by knitting the `Assignment-B-1.Rmd` file to 'GitHub-flavoured' markdown. The contents of this file exactly match those of `Assignment-B-1.Rmd`, but these can be viewed entirely through GitHub without requiring any downloads.
- [`README.md`](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/assignment-b1-hotz1/blob/main/README.md): The file which you are reading at the moment. It is a standard README file, which is useful for orienting yourself with the project and the repository as a whole.
- [`Assignment-B-1_files/figure-gfm/`](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/assignment-b1-hotz1/tree/main/Assignment-B-1_files/figure-gfm/): A folder within the GitHub repository which contains several PNG files. Each of these images is a plot which is displayed in `Assignment-B-1.md`, and these images exist as part of the repository because that is how GitHub stores images which are displayed in markdown files on the repository.

## How do I use this repository?

Great question! If you would just like to read the existing work on the assignment and see the plots and unit tests, then you can open `Assignment-B-1.md` in GitHub (no download needed), which contains all of the work on Assignment B-1 in an easy-to-read format without requiring any downloads or any additional labour on your part.

If you would like to use R and RMarkdown to actually use the function which was defined in this project, or you would like to do some unit testing of your own, then you can download `Assignment-B-1.Rmd` from GitHub (and the other files in the repository, if you desire), and run the code chunk-by-chunk in that file. The R libraries/packages required for this project are `tidyverse`, `datateachr`, and `testthat`.
